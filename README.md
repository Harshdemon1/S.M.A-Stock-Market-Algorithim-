# S.M.A-Stock-Market-Algorithim-
Currently in Alpha Development 


S.M.A or Stock Market algorithim is an algorithim
that takes Data from Financial Modelling Prep which
is a Free database contiaining Data on multiple stocks
and used by multiple Stock-Trading Platforms such as
Tradingview to Instantly fetch Data on a stock
for the user.

S.M.A uses an Api to fetch Data on a stock that
a user wishes to find.The Data delivered contains
metrics such as Growth,Quality,Sentiment,momentum
and value of the stock and analysis such values 
into a score out of 100 and gives a signal
depending on duch score.

S.M.A also changes its score in real time adapting
sudden changes in price and can analyse news related
to stock and change its score accordingly

So far the number of stocks that can be measured
are limited as the algorithim is in alpha development
and the scores given are not completly accurate.
